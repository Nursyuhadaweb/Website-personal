<h2 style="color: brown">Hello! This is a story about me!</h2>
<img src="image 1.jpeg" height="450px" width="400px">
<p>	My name is Nur Syuhada binti Zamri. People usually call me Syu or Adda. I was born in Kemaman, Terengganu and I live in Kuantan, Pahang. I have five siblings and I am the eldest. I am a cheerful person, but sometimes I can be a fierce person too. Now I am studying in Diploma of Information Management at UiTM Machang, Kelantan. Due to pandemic Covid-19 I can’t live in UiTM. Hence, I stay at home and undergoing online classes. I miss my life as a student at university such as go to the classes every morning, eating at café, short vacation with friends during the weekend, etc.</p>

<p>I have a few key features that I want to share. First, I can do the best work in groups. I give full of my commitment in my group by giving valuable ideas, helping my groupmates, and completing the work on time. For example, when our groups facing some problems, I can give ideas or a good alternatives as our solution to solve the problems. Besides that, if one of my groupmates has problem about their task, I can help them by giving suggestion or seek information through my friends.</p>

<p>Other than that, I am a productive person. I don’t like to wasting my time by doing something that is not useful. When I a have free time, I like to plan my schedule for upcoming day. I will plan what assignment that I need to do tomorrow, what topics that I need to study and finding time to focus on my small business for a while.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am a caring person and always give motivation to people around me when they are down or have issues. I don’t like to see people around me sad or down because it is not good for our mental health. Thus, I can bring good vibes to them.</p>

<p>That’s all about me, thank you :’)</p>
